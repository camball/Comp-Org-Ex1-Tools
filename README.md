# Comp-Org-Ex1-Tools
A suite of tools to help myself and other students handle the numerical calculations, numerical representations, and MIPS RISC assembly language coding, in preparation for our exam 1. 

To build the executable, simply download the source code files and run the make utility in the directory that contains the file dependencies. 

So far I have only finished functions that calculate CPU Time and MFLOPS ratings, and show the work as if calculated by hand. I have it in the works to show work for converting between clock rate and clock period and vice-versa, but I don't know if it's worth finishing it as the exam will be over before I have the chance to finish that.
