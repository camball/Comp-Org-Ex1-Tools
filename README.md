# Comp-Org-Ex1-Tools
A small suite of tools to help myself and other students handle the numerical calculations, numerical representations, and MIPS RISC assembly language coding, in preparation for our exam 1. 

So far, only the functions that calculate (and show the work as if calculated by hand) CPU Time and MFLOPS ratings are finished. ~~I have it in the works to show work for converting between clock rate and clock period and vice-versa, but I don't know if it's worth finishing it as the exam will be over before I have the chance to finish that.~~ I doubt any of the other functionality will ever be implemented, as I will never have a use for this code anymore.

## Installation/How to Run
To build from source, download repo and run the `make` utility in the repo directory.
